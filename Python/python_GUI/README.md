## gui_popup.py ##
This is a work in progress code. The final goal is to start up a sensor sweet through GUIs and can save what sensors are connected to what ports on a local config file. There is a fair amount of work remaining on this project. 
This is for MOVEUAS, which is a club I am in, and I also created their GitHub which I follow. 
## sensors_UART_configs.json
This is the config file mentioned earlier. This also shows the correct formating.
